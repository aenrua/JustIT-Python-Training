"Arithmetic expression evaluates to a number"

num1 = 10  # static object/value
num2 = 5  # static object/value
num3 = 11  # static object/value
num4 = 2  # static object/value

# + operator is use for addition and also concatenation(join things)

print("Addition: " + str(num1) + " + " + str(num2) + "=", num1 + num2)

# Using f-strings to format print statement (f followed by quotes)
# strings cater for all data types

# plus operator +
print(f"Using f-strings\nAddition: {num1} + {num2} = { num1 + num2} ")

"To Do: Task 1: What is the equivalent of f-strings in JavaScript?"
# Answer: Template literals

"Review the code below to answer the following questions"
"Task 1: Explain in your own words the operators listed below "
# Division (/) - divides values
# Floor Division (//) - divides values and rounds down to the nearest whole number
# Modulus (%) - shows the only the remainder that is left after 2 values have been divided

"To Do: Explain in your own words when you would use the operators listed above"
# Division (/) - when you want to the divided value between 2 values
# Floor Division (//) - same as above but you only want the whole number
# Modulus (%) - when you only want to see the remainder after 2 values have been divided by each other

# division /
print(f"Division (/): {num3} / {num4}  = {num3 / num4}")

# Floor division
print(f"Floor division (//): {num3} / {num4}  = {num3 // num4}")

# Modulus %
print(f"Modulus (%): {num3} / {num4}  = {num3 % num4}")
