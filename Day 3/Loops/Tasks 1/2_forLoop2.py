# for variableName in rangeObject(numberOfIteration)
# for loops that use the range() function
# range() is the sequence that you are going to iterate through
# range() is a built-in function just like input(). 


# range(stop) -> range object range(start, stop[, step]) -> range object
# When you call the range function, you can pass it up to three values: 
# The start number
# The end number
# The step 

"To Do: Predict, then Run, and then Investigate"

"Task 4: Modify the code you produced in task 3 to count down in steps of 5 (from a high number(30) to a low number greater or equal to 0)"
